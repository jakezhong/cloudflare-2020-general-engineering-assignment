# Cloudflare 2020 General Engineering Assignment - Jake Zhong
This is a Cloudflare Worker project done by using the Cloudflare Wrangler. 

## It has two majors missions based on the requirements.
* Generate a JSON API with an array of link objects (name and url).
* Render a static HTML page with the same array of link objects.

## Notes
* To fetch the JSON API, make sure you include the keyword “/links” in the url, for example, https://general-engineering-assignment.jzhong1.workers.dev/links.
* If no “/links” is provided in the url, then the default static HTML page will be rendered and displayed. The static HTML page has been customized and styled by me with the theme color of Cloudflare, and I hope you like it.
